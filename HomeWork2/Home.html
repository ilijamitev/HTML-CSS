            <h3>Pug</h3>
            <p>
                The pug is a breed of dog originally from China, with physically distinctive features of a wrinkly,
                short-muzzled face
                and curled tail. The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colors, most often light
                brown
                (fawn) or
                black, and a compact, square body with well-developed muscles.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in Western Europe
                by
                the
                House of
                Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart.[2] In the United Kingdom, in the nineteenth century,
                Queen
                Victoria
                developed a passion for pugs which she passed on to other members of the Royal family.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pugs are known for being sociable and gentle companion dogs.[3] The American Kennel Club describes the
                breed's
                personality as "even-tempered and charming".[4] Pugs remain popular into the twenty-first century, with
                some
                famous
                celebrity owners.

            <h3>English Bulldog</h3>
            <p>
                The Bulldog,[4] also known as the English Bulldog or British Bulldog, is a medium-sized dog breed. It is
                a
                muscular,
                hefty dog with a wrinkled face and a distinctive pushed-in nose.[5] The Kennel Club (UK), the American
                Kennel Club (US),
                and the United Kennel Club (US) oversee breeding records. Bulldogs are popular pets; they were the fifth
                most popular
                purebreed in the US in 2017 according to the American Kennel Club.[6]
            </p>

            <p>
                Bulldogs have a longstanding association with British culture, as the BBC wrote: "to many the Bulldog is
                a
                national
                icon, symbolising pluck and determination."[7] During World War II, Bulldogs were often likened to Prime
                Minister
                Winston Churchill and his defiance of Nazi Germany.[8] The Bulldog Club (England) was formed in 1878,
                and
                the Bulldog
                Club of America was formed in 1890.
